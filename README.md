# TC-Charger-CAN-controller
The source code for the CAN controller for TC chargers can be found here, as well as the correct library for the MCP chip which works straight away with Leonardo CAN-BUS boards.

Special thanks to Lennart Otten (https://github.com/Lennart-O/TCCharger-voltage-current-control) for its source code of CAN communication.

Special mention to Cohesive Computing for their helpful menu builder (https://www.cohesivecomputing.co.uk/hackatronics/arduino-lcd-menu-library/countdown-timer/#comment-7726).
